## **Contents**

### **1. Machine Learning Algorithms**
- **Linear Regression**:
  - Implemented from scratch and using common libraries.
  - Explored gradient descent and closed-form solutions.
  
- **Logistic Regression**:
  - Applied for binary classification tasks.
  - Visualized decision boundaries and explored sigmoid function.

- **Neural Networks**:
  - Built basic feedforward neural networks.
  - Explored concepts like activation functions, backpropagation, and gradient descent.

### **2. Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core language for implementing the algorithms.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and documentation.
